    WarehouseStore is a generic class for a warehouse store.

    A WarehouseStore is a store that can be used to store and retrieve unit loads.
    The unit loads are stored in WarehouseLocations, which are located in the WarehouseStore.
    The WarehouseStore serves AGVs, and it is responsible for the loading and unloading of unit loads
    from the AGVs.

    Attributes:
        input_location: InputLocation of the store, where AGVs can unload unit loads.
        output_location: OutputLocation of the store, where AGVs can retrieve unit loads.
        location_width: fixed width of the locations in the store.
        location_height: fixed height of the locations in the store.
        depth: fixed depth of the locations in the store.
        n_positions: number of positions in each floor of the store.
        n_floors: number of floors of the store.
        load_time: time required to load a unit load into the store.
        conveyor_capacity: capacity of the conveyor connecting the store to the AGVs.
